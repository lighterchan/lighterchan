- 👋 Hi, I’m @lighterchan
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and creating interesting coding experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code better, by keep asking "if(true?){why true} else {why not}".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a lighter and better framework, tool set, coding concept or event a new programming language proposal to make everyone code lighter, better and happier.
- 📫 How to reach me ...well, welcome to reach me through coding ^^
